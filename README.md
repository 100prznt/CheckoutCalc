# CheckoutCalc
 
Calculate checkout ways depending on your own favorite fields. 

## Idea

I don't know if it's just me, but I have favorite fields that I hit better.
As this was only a subjective guess at first, I drew up a training plan and recorded my hit rate again and again over a few days. This resulted in a ranking list of my personal favorite fields, the higher the rank, the more reliably I hit the field (for example see [personal_rates.json](personal_rates.json)).
When it comes to simply playing down the field, it works from memory to play to my favorite fields. It's a bit more difficult with the checkout. That's why I created my own checkout table and put it beside the board. However, over the time, my personal rank of some fields has changed and I would have to change the checkout table. I developed the "CheckoutCalc" tool so that I don't have to calculate all the ways one by one. This imports the ranking list and outputs checkout ways for straight, double and triple out.
